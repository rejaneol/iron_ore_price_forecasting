# Forecasting Commodities Prices: Iron Ore

## Summary
In this project, a time series approach was used to model and forecast iron ore prices.

## Motivation: 
As the article from Visual Capitalist shows ([From Bust to Boom: Visualizing the Rise in Commodity Prices](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-rise-in-commodity-prices/)), commodities are "the stuff that makes everything".

## The project

The project was developed in a Python Jupyter Notebook: [iron-ore-prices-forecasting.ipynb](https://github.com/rejaneol/iron_ore_price_forecasting/blob/main/iron-ore-prices-forecasting.ipynb)  

The **packages** and versions are listed below:  
pandas==1.0.3  
numpy==1.18.1  
matplotlib==3.1.3  
seaborn==0.10.1  
scikit-learn==0.22  
OUTROS

In the _Business Understanding_ and _Data Understanding_ phase, we investigated:
1. The aspects of Iron Ore Prices historical data
2. Additional variables that could influence the iron ore prices (exogenous variables), like 

In the _Modeling_ phase, we.. An ARIMAX model was fitted and showed a MAPE of about 19% .

The main findings were:
*
